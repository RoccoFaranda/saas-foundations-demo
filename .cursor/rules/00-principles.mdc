# Core Project Principles

## Public Demo Safety + Polished UX Intent
- This is a public-facing demo application. Prioritize polished, professional UX.
- All features should work smoothly and provide clear feedback to users.
- Error states should be user-friendly, not exposing internal details.

## Security: No Secrets/Tokens in Logs
**CRITICAL**: Never log sensitive information including:
- Auth tokens (JWT, session tokens, refresh tokens)
- Password reset links
- Stripe secrets, API keys, or webhook signatures
- Bot tokens or API credentials
- Any PII that shouldn't be exposed

Use structured logging with sanitization for any user-generated or external data.

## Development Workflow
- **Small incremental changes**: Prefer small, reviewable PR-sized diffs
- **No repo-wide refactors**: Avoid large-scale refactors unless explicitly requested
- **Tests-first/alongside**: Add or update tests when changing behavior
- **Type safety**: Keep TypeScript strict; use explicit types at boundaries

## Next.js Server/Client Boundary Guidance
- Understand and respect the server/client component boundary
- Server Components are the default; use "use client" only when necessary
- Don't import server-only modules (database, auth helpers) into client components
- Keep route handlers thin: validate → call service → return response

## Standard API Error Shape
All API errors should follow this consistent format:
```typescript
{
  error: {
    code: string,    // e.g., "VALIDATION_ERROR", "UNAUTHORIZED", "NOT_FOUND"
    message: string  // User-friendly error message
  }
}
```

## Guest Mode Behavior
- **No DB writes**: Guest users cannot write to the database
- **Refresh resets**: Page refresh resets all business data to seeded demo state
- **Theme persistence**: Only theme preference is allowed in localStorage
- **In-memory state**: Guest mode uses seeded demo data + in-memory state only
